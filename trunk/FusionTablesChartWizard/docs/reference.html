    <h1>Fusion Tables Chart Wizard</h1>

    <p>
      This wizard helps you create a highly customized chart based on 
      data in a Fusion Table. The output of the wizard is the URL and HTML code
      that can be used to embed the chart in another web page or be used as part of a mash-up. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to use the Wizard you need to know the
      docid of a public or unlisted Fusion Table with data you
      would like to chart. 
      In addition you will need to know which columns
      contain the data for the chart. 
    </p>
    <p>
      By default only the first 100 rows will be fetched and you
      can then use a chart editor to customize the type of chart and its properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Basic Options
      section you can change the row limit as well as
      filter and sort the rows. 
      The Advanced Options section allows for more
      complex customization of the data used for the chart.
