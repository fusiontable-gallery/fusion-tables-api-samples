    <h1>
      Synchronizing a Google Form with a Fusion Table
    </h1>
    <p>
      With a simple script, you can set up a Google Form that your users
      can use to input data to a Fusion Table. The script takes advantage
      of <a href="http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/">Google's
           Apps Script tool</a> to transfer new form input into your table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="reference-roleaccount.html">previous version</a> of these
      instructions required a role account and a publicly visible password;
      this version automatically uses your credentials to safely connect to
      Fusion Tables instead.

        Plan out your data. If you are collecting
        <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/fusiontables/docs/developers_guide.html#Geo">geographic
          data</a> that contains a street address such as &quot;1600
        Amphitheatre Parkway, MV, 94043&quot; or a text location string such
        as &quot;Yosemite Park&quot; and you need Fusion Tables to geocode
        them for you, there are some additional steps to follow (noted below).
      </p>
      <p>
        Also note that once you have started collecting data, you can not
        make any changes to the form or Fusion Table.

      <h2>
        Create your form, spreadsheet, and Fusion Table

      <p>
        Your form will be backed by a spreadsheet, to which you will add triggering code
        to copy the responses to a Fusion Table.

        Form and spreadsheet

      <ol>
        <li>
          From <a href="https://drive.google.com" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> click
          "Create &gt; Form" to create a new form. Set up your desired form questions
          and give it a useful title.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click "Choose response destination" from the toolbar at the top of the form editor.
          In the resulting dialog select:

        <li>
          Click on the "View responses" link in the gray bar at the top of the page to see the
          newly created spreadsheet. Note that the form automatically creates a Timestamp column.

            <li>
              Click the blue "+ Connect" button to add the app.
            </li>
            <li>
              You should see a dialog box saying "Google Tables was connected to Google Drive."

          Double check that the column names in the spreadsheet and Fusion
          Table match exactly. By default, they should match, but if for any
          reason they do not, go in and change the spreadsheet columns to
          match the table's columns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure that you saved your properties in the Project Properties tab,
